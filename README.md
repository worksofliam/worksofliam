### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Some may also know me as Barry â˜º

I primarily work with Node.js/TS and C, but previously used other languages like C# and PHP. I am invested heavily into the IBM i industry to help people learn other tech (like Node.js, AWS, Azure, modern development practices, so on!). I love working on and creating dev tools to make developing applications easier for everyone in the long run. I am now working at IBM as a Advisory Software Engineer, working with clients and open-source software. I of course love, love, love open-source! Oh, and I sometimes speak at conferences.

[Check out my blog](https://github.com/worksofliam/blog/issues).
